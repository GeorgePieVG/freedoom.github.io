= Help Freedoom!
// See COPYING.adoc for license terms of this file.

Freedoom is always looking to improve.  This is a short list of some of
the resources that the project may need.  If you can help out,
please check the forum or Discord links in the sidebar to get in contact!

== Level authors

**Bugs**: Sometimes bugs get reported in Freedoom's levels.  Check out
the https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/labels/levels[bug list] to
see what currently needs fixing.

== Bug reports

Freedoom is an ongoing project, and issues may always be found.  The
preferred place, and the one that will not have reports lost in
memory, is the https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom/issues[GitHub
issue tracker].  Information about all kinds of issues is much
appreciated, but if you find an issue in the latest release, don't be
so quick to report it!  Check the
http://freedoom.soulsphere.org/[latest and greatest builds] to see if
the problem still persists there: much of Freedoom may have changed in
the interim!

== Website

This website is also managed via git.  If you have suggestions please
either raise issues or pull requests at
https://github.com/freedoom/freedoom.github.io[the freedoom.github.io
GitHub project].

== Financial contributions

Freedoom does not accept financial donations nor bug bounties.  While
such desires to support us this way are appreciated, we do not have a
present need for financial assistance with development or hosting.

Spread the word instead! Share your love for Freedoom
and encourage others to try it.
